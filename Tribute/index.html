      <p>
        Sunderlal Bahuguna Ji (9 January 1927 - 21 May 2021) was an Indian
        environmentalist and Chipko movement leader. The idea of the Chipko
        movement was suggested by his wife and him. He fought for the
        preservation of forests in the Himalayas, first as a member of the
        Chipko movement in the 1970s, and later spearheaded the anti-Tehri Dam
        movement from the 1980s to early 2004. He was one of the early
        environmentalists of India, and later he and others associated with the
        Chipko movement and started taking up wider environmental issues, such
        as being opposed to large dams.

        Sunderlal Bahuguna was born in the village Maroda near Tehri,
        Uttarakhand. Early on, he fought against untouchability and later
        started organising hill women in his anti-liquor drive from 1965 to
        1970. He started social activities at the age of 13, under the guidance
        of Shri Dev Suman, who was a nationalist spreading a message of
        non-violence, and he was with the Congress Party of Uttar Pradesh at the
        time of Independence. Bahuguna also mobilised people against colonial
        rule before 1947.He adopted Gandhian principles in his life and married
        his wife Vimla with the condition that they would live among rural
        people and establish ashram in village. Inspired by Gandhi, he walked
        through Himalayan forests and hills, covering more than 4,700 kilometres
        on foot and observed the damage done by mega developmental projects on
        the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas and subsequent degradation of
        social life in villages.

        While best known as an environmental activist and as a passionate
        defender of the Himalayan people and India's rivers, Bahuguna also
        worked to improve the plight of the hill people, especially working
        women, and was associated with temperance movements and earlier on with
        struggles against casteist discrimination.

        Bahuguna died on May 21, 2021, due to COVID-19 complications.Shortly
        after, he was commemorated by Amul in one of its advertisements. On May
        21, 2022, Bahuguna's daughter, Madhu Pathak edited and published a
        souvenir book on his life and work. This book has contributions from
        reputed social activists, writers, intellectuals and politicians. In
        addition to Bahuguna's life and work, this book also helps the reader in
        understanding ecological mass-movements in Garhwal Himalayan region.
